# The Pragmatic Programmer | Challenges: Prototypes And Post-it Notes (page 56)

### Question 1

Marketing would like to sit down and brainstorm a few Web-page designs with
you. They are thinking of clickable image maps to take you to other pages, and so on. But they can’t decide on a model for the image—maybe it’s a car, or a phone, or a house. You have a list of target pages and content; they’d like to see a few prototypes. Oh, by the way, you have 15 minutes. What tools might you use?

### Solution 1

Given the short period of time I have to come up with a prototype, the tools I will go for would be:
- pen (preferably a pencil)
- paper
